# Intro_to_self_driving_cars_UofT

This repository contains the final course project of the course "Introduction to self driving cars" on Coursera offered by University of Toronto 
This project was implemented on predefined CARLA environment provided as part of course. I have implemented the following, 
- MPC for lateral control of a self driving car.
- PID for longitudinal control of a self driving car.
